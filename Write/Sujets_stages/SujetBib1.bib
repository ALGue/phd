	abstract = {Rising demands for agricultural products will increase pressure to further intensify crop production, while negative environmental impacts have to be minimized. Ecological intensification entails the environmentally friendly replacement of anthropogenic inputs and/or enhancement of crop productivity, by including regulating and supporting ecosystem services management in agricultural practices. Effective ecological intensification requires an understanding of the relations between land use at different scales and the community composition of ecosystem service-providing organisms above and below ground, and the flow, stability, contribution to yield, and management costs of the multiple services delivered by these organisms. Research efforts and investments are particularly needed to reduce existing yield gaps by integrating context-appropriate bundles of ecosystem services into crop production systems.},

	abstract = {The green–blue network of semi-natural non-crop landscape elements in agricultural landscapes has the potential to enhance natural pest control by providing various resources for the survival of beneficial insects that suppress crop pests. A study was done in the Hoeksche Waard to explore how generic scientific knowledge about the relationship between the spatial structure of the green–blue network and enhancement of natural pest control can be applied by stakeholders. The Hoeksche Waard is an agricultural area in the Netherlands, characterized by arable fields and an extensive network of dikes, creeks, ditches and field margins. Together with stakeholders from the area the research team developed spatial norms and design rules for the design of a green–blue network that supports natural pest control. The stakeholders represented different interests in the area: farmers, nature and landscape conservationists, water managers, and local and regional politicians. Knowledge about the spatial relationship among beneficial insects, pests and landscape structure is incomplete. We conclude that to apply scientific knowledge about natural pest control and the role of green–blue networks to stakeholders so that they can apply it in landscape change, knowledge transfer has to be transparent, area specific, understandable, practical and incorporate local knowledge.},

	abstract = {Natural pest control is an important ecosystem service that is rapidly declining in the United States. Farmers may be able to increase the provision of natural pest control by working together. However, little is known about US farmers' willingness to cooperate to control pests. In this study, we survey 229 Missouri crop farmers to explore farmers' willingness to cooperate. We find that 91\% say they are willing to cooperate to control pests, and that simple, local cooperative efforts may be more popular than formal, county-wide efforts. In addition, the determinants that affect willingness to cooperate follow those predicted by the collective action, agricultural adoption, and ecosystem management literatures. Specifically, farmers who believe that they will receive a net benefit, have farms similar to their neighbors', are active members of a community organization, have positive contact with agricultural extension agents, and are concerned about the effect that pesticides may have on the environment are more willing to cooperate than farmers who do not share these characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the conditions that may foster cooperation between farmers in the provision of an ecosystem service. Plus, it may help facilitate the formation of pest control cooperatives in the United States.},

	abstract = {This study integrates field-based survey data with spatially-explicitsimulation modelling to assess the relative benefits of different landscapemanagement strategies for sustainable agricultural practice. We focus on the roleof native vegetation remnants in Australian agricultural landscapes in harbouringpests and beneficial insects for Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Nativevegetation remnants exist in most agricultural regions of Australia, although theirextent and composition varies greatly. Field-based surveys conducted in 2010 and2011 across three states provide important information on source habitats for pestsand natural enemies and their movement between habitats during the croppingseason. Building on this novel information, spatially-explicit simulation models wereconstructed integrating natural enemy life history traits, dispersal behaviour andhabitat use, to examine the implications for pest and beneficial insects of modifyingagricultural landscapes for IPM. Computer simulated landscapes were modified bymanipulating the amount, quality and composition of native vegetation. We use themodels to identify landscape designs associated with effective top-downsuppression of pest populations by natural enemies. Throughout the project,stakeholders (farmers, agronomists and policy makers) have been activelyengaged to advise the project about IPM options that are compatible with currentfarming systems, and to regularly communicate the findings of the field studies,model development and potential management plans. The findings of theexperimental work and the modelling are combined to produce a set of guidingprinciples for IPM practices that consider the landscape context. This will allowfarmers to (i) increase their benefit from the ecosystem service of pest control, and(ii) enhance the sustainable use and management of natural resources. This workhas potential to influence agricultural land use policy in Australia, with further workplanned to model the implications of landscape change and non-crop habitatmanagement strategies for multiple ecosystem services.},
